2300-131720-0009,for some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously,9.605,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0009.flac
2300-131720-0010,it could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current,10.82,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0010.flac
2300-131720-0011,but when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb a group of dwellings on the outskirts a remote country residence or a farm house the alternating current in all elements save its danger was and is ideal,15.875,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0011.flac
2300-131720-0012,edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross examination by microscope test tube and galvanometer,11.145,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0012.flac
2300-131720-0013,unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light,13.89,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0013.flac
2300-131720-0014,mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time,3.75,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0014.flac
2300-131720-0015,he obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it,8.875,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0015.flac
2300-131720-0016,then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times,20.015,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0016.flac
2300-131720-0017,edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind,19.915,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0017.flac
2300-131720-0018,he soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities,12.54,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0018.flac
2300-131720-0019,the strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting,14.82,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0019.flac
2300-131720-0020,it was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation,10.35,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0020.flac
2300-131720-0021,the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations,10.95,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0021.flac
2300-131720-0022,meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time,13.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0022.flac
2300-131720-0023,i think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up,11.06,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0023.flac
2300-131720-0024,but the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country,4.77,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0024.flac
2300-131720-0025,they were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three,15.28,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0025.flac
2300-131720-0026,the arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident,17.595,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0026.flac
2300-131720-0027,edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter,8.62,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0027.flac
2300-131720-0028,there was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration,25.94,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0028.flac
2300-131720-0029,hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities,6.425,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0029.flac
2300-131720-0030,the principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance,9.98,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0030.flac
2300-131720-0031,associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage,16.585,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0031.flac
2300-131720-0032,the standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted,11.69,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0032.flac
2300-131720-0033,in december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other,17.605,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0033.flac

2300-131720-0035,in this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter,25.49,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0035.flac
2300-131720-0036,the meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century,7.085,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0036.flac
2300-131720-0037,he weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain,7.965,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0037.flac
2300-131720-0038,he felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better,5.61,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0038.flac
2300-131720-0039,the problem was solved,2.385,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0039.flac
2300-131720-0040,we were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part,5.455,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0040.flac
2300-131720-0041,we had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid,3.75,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2300-131720-0041.flac

2961-960-0015,the style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues,7.83,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0015.flac
2961-960-0016,but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium,7.76,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0016.flac
2961-960-0017,nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner,7.87,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0017.flac
2961-960-0018,but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up,8.38,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0018.flac
2961-960-0019,he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena,12.13,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0019.flac
2961-960-0020,and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius,9.88,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0020.flac
2961-960-0021,there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings,15.785,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0021.flac
2961-960-0022,plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art,7.425,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-960-0022.flac
2961-961-0000,socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic,4.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0000.flac
2961-961-0001,and now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle,9.185,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0001.flac
2961-961-0002,and therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse,19.99,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0002.flac

2961-961-0004,listen then socrates to a tale of solon's who being the friend of dropidas my great grandfather told it to my grandfather critias and he told me,11.48,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0004.flac

2961-961-0006,and what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark,4.6,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0006.flac
2961-961-0007,the subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged,8.505,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0007.flac
2961-961-0008,but the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors,7.155,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0008.flac

2961-961-0010,but in egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples,7.83,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0010.flac
2961-961-0011,the genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children's story,7.815,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0011.flac

2961-961-0018,the most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis,5.29,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0018.flac
2961-961-0019,for at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars,12.255,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0019.flac

2961-961-0021,but i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory,4.94,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0021.flac
2961-961-0022,then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke,25.985,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/2961-961-0022.flac
3570-5694-0000,but already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system,12.085,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0000.flac
3570-5694-0001,the utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth,5.675,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0001.flac
3570-5694-0002,such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life,10.615,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0002.flac
3570-5694-0003,with a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily,19.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0003.flac
3570-5694-0004,in the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class,5.33,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0004.flac
3570-5694-0005,under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class,8.405,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0005.flac
3570-5694-0006,drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence,14.505,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0006.flac
3570-5694-0007,it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle,10.545,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0007.flac
3570-5694-0008,the consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master,9.495,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0008.flac
3570-5694-0009,with many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters,12.605,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0009.flac
3570-5694-0010,the objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial,13.005,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0010.flac
3570-5694-0011,the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives,11.03,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0011.flac
3570-5694-0012,there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades,3.205,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0012.flac
3570-5694-0013,this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility,5.61,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0013.flac
3570-5694-0014,many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers,11.255,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0014.flac
3570-5694-0015,so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification,8.435,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0015.flac
3570-5694-0016,many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera,14.15,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0016.flac
3570-5694-0017,the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible,8.335,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0017.flac
3570-5694-0018,the wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble,7.815,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0018.flac
3570-5694-0019,but the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked,3.755,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0019.flac
3570-5694-0020,so those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments,14.035,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0020.flac
3570-5694-0021,whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character,10.555,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0021.flac
3570-5694-0022,the livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it,4.295,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5694-0022.flac
3570-5695-0000,in a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide,4.83,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0000.flac
3570-5695-0001,the dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last,14.715,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0001.flac
3570-5695-0002,but as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone,7.805,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0002.flac
3570-5695-0003,in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class,5.355,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0003.flac
3570-5695-0004,if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort,10.6,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0004.flac
3570-5695-0005,the man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency,20.03,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0005.flac
3570-5695-0006,very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away,7.47,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0006.flac
3570-5695-0007,there is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need,9.755,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0007.flac
3570-5695-0008,the question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect,6.845,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0008.flac
3570-5695-0009,each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth,5.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0009.flac
3570-5695-0010,the modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line,4.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0010.flac
3570-5695-0011,it is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure,8.26,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0011.flac
3570-5695-0012,it is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest,14.76,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0012.flac
3570-5695-0013,consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country,4.64,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0013.flac
3570-5695-0014,among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute,10.54,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0014.flac
3570-5695-0015,the result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen,7.95,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5695-0015.flac
3570-5696-0000,under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset,11.415,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0000.flac
3570-5696-0001,but the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture,16.735,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0001.flac
3570-5696-0002,other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use,7.51,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0002.flac
3570-5696-0003,a reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic,25.115,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0003.flac
3570-5696-0004,the salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated,4.7,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0004.flac
3570-5696-0005,throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities,13.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0005.flac
3570-5696-0006,as used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation,4.16,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0006.flac
3570-5696-0007,the use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste,9.5,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0007.flac
3570-5696-0008,but it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful,7.26,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0008.flac
3570-5696-0009,in strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison,8.86,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0009.flac
3570-5696-0010,an article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions,7.57,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/3570-5696-0010.flac

672-122797-0039,i won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree,4.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0039.flac
672-122797-0040,and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought,5.125,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0040.flac
672-122797-0041,in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in,3.88,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0041.flac

672-122797-0043,what's the meaning of this thought the tree,3.78,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0043.flac
672-122797-0044,and he leaned against the wall lost in reverie,3.74,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0044.flac
672-122797-0045,time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way,13.96,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/672-122797-0045.flac

6930-76324-0019,now let's dust the furniture and pictures,2.575,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0019.flac
6930-76324-0020,yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room,6.315,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0020.flac
6930-76324-0021,surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish,7.355,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0021.flac
6930-76324-0022,then she suddenly remarked,1.895,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0022.flac
6930-76324-0023,and my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual,4.85,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0023.flac
6930-76324-0024,they say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world,4.05,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0024.flac
6930-76324-0025,why it's goliath as usual they both cried peering in,4.12,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0025.flac
6930-76324-0026,isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners,3.085,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0026.flac
6930-76324-0027,forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner,8.27,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0027.flac
6930-76324-0028,well i'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later,9.875,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-76324-0028.flac
6930-81414-0000,no words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality,12.895,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0000.flac
6930-81414-0001,i heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffar his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me,17.485,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0001.flac
6930-81414-0002,onward said a distant voice,3.305,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0002.flac
6930-81414-0003,no sound broke the stillness of the night,3.295,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0003.flac
6930-81414-0004,the story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said,9.56,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0004.flac
6930-81414-0005,what was that,1.815,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0005.flac
6930-81414-0006,what then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond,6.8,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0006.flac
6930-81414-0007,nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached,4.365,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0007.flac
6930-81414-0008,it did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death,6.055,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0008.flac
6930-81414-0009,i awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with a phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffar,12.015,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0009.flac
6930-81414-0010,a sound of voices a flash of light,3.835,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0010.flac
6930-81414-0011,a feeling of freedom and i was awake where,4.7,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0011.flac
6930-81414-0012,said another voice which i recognized as voltaire's kaffar,4.43,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0012.flac
6930-81414-0013,i had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand,7.325,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0013.flac
6930-81414-0014,in the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured,7.41,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0014.flac
6930-81414-0015,i do not know i am dazed bewildered,3.73,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0015.flac
6930-81414-0016,but that is kaffar's knife,2.16,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0016.flac
6930-81414-0017,i know he had it this very evening,2.34,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0017.flac
6930-81414-0018,i remember saying have we been together,2.93,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0018.flac
6930-81414-0019,voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it,3.38,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0019.flac
6930-81414-0020,i say you do know what this means and you must tell us,5.0,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0020.flac
6930-81414-0021,a terrible thought flashed into my mind,3.225,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0021.flac
6930-81414-0022,i had again been acting under the influence of this man's power,4.34,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0022.flac
6930-81414-0023,perchance too kaffar's death might serve him in good stead,4.885,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0023.flac
6930-81414-0024,my tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me,5.05,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0024.flac
6930-81414-0025,my position was too terrible,2.53,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0025.flac
6930-81414-0026,my overwrought nerves yielded at last,3.075,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0026.flac
6930-81414-0027,for some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly,3.85,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/6930-81414-0027.flac
7021-79730-0000,the three modes of management,2.44,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0000.flac
7021-79730-0001,to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design,11.49,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0001.flac
7021-79730-0002,by reason and affection,2.69,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0002.flac
7021-79730-0004,the mother as soon as the chaise is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice,17.945,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0004.flac
7021-79730-0005,so you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you,8.01,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0005.flac
7021-79730-0006,the mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection,11.34,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0006.flac
7021-79730-0007,if you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone,12.455,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0007.flac
7021-79730-0008,but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble,11.765,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0008.flac
7021-79730-0009,it is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated,12.585,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79730-0009.flac
7021-79740-0000,to such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful,11.125,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0000.flac
7021-79740-0001,della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane,5.995,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0001.flac
7021-79740-0002,now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls,9.225,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0002.flac
7021-79740-0003,to give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full,4.985,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0003.flac
7021-79740-0004,you have come andella andella was the name of jane's doll to make rosalie a visit,6.465,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0004.flac
7021-79740-0005,i am very glad,2.11,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0005.flac
7021-79740-0006,i expect you have been a very good girl andella since you were here last,5.965,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0006.flac
7021-79740-0007,then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane,6.99,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0007.flac
7021-79740-0008,for instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done,18.415,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0008.flac
7021-79740-0009,they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor,3.635,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0009.flac
7021-79740-0010,delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and don't say a word to them,12.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0010.flac
7021-79740-0011,so saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there,10.315,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0011.flac
7021-79740-0012,said she pointing to the playthings see,3.26,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0012.flac
7021-79740-0013,put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out,7.365,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0013.flac
7021-79740-0014,and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been,14.175,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79740-0014.flac
7021-79759-0000,nature of the effect produced by early impressions,4.775,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0000.flac
7021-79759-0001,that is comparatively nothing,2.48,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0001.flac
7021-79759-0002,they are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood,5.25,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0002.flac
7021-79759-0003,vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing,4.62,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0003.flac
7021-79759-0004,without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresses upon the mind,24.47,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0004.flac
7021-79759-0005,the pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain,13.02,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-79759-0005.flac
7021-85628-0000,but anders cared nothing about that,3.02,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0000.flac
7021-85628-0001,he made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders,11.33,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0001.flac
7021-85628-0002,he was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife,6.455,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0002.flac
7021-85628-0003,now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife,15.29,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0003.flac
7021-85628-0004,yes why not thought anders,2.805,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0004.flac
7021-85628-0005,seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king,5.015,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0005.flac
7021-85628-0006,i am going to the court ball answered anders,3.58,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0006.flac
7021-85628-0007,and she took anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went,16.675,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0007.flac
7021-85628-0008,for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap,7.125,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0008.flac
7021-85628-0009,at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows,8.54,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0009.flac
7021-85628-0010,on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters,8.015,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0010.flac
7021-85628-0011,the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side,8.995,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0011.flac
7021-85628-0012,but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off,5.33,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0012.flac
7021-85628-0013,the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition,12.13,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0013.flac
7021-85628-0014,he only shook his head,2.295,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0014.flac
7021-85628-0015,well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him,11.545,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0015.flac
7021-85628-0016,that is a very fine cap you have he said,4.28,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0016.flac
7021-85628-0017,so it is said anders,2.155,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0017.flac
7021-85628-0018,and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me,8.22,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0018.flac
7021-85628-0019,with one jump anders got out of his chair,3.255,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0019.flac
7021-85628-0020,he darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard,6.45,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0020.flac
7021-85628-0021,he still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage,5.365,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0021.flac
7021-85628-0022,and all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open,5.145,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0022.flac
7021-85628-0023,but when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that anders was a stupid,9.03,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0023.flac
7021-85628-0024,anders face grew red,2.165,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0024.flac
7021-85628-0025,but his mother hugged him close,2.775,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0025.flac
7021-85628-0026,no my little son she said,2.74,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0026.flac
7021-85628-0027,if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap,8.5,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7021-85628-0027.flac
7127-75946-0000,at the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court,19.475,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7127-75946-0000.flac
7127-75946-0001,ah very well,2.17,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7127-75946-0001.flac
7127-75946-0002,let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers,13.19,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7127-75946-0002.flac
7127-75946-0003,gentlemen to your posts whereupon saint aignan and villeroy took their leave,4.81,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/7127-75946-0003.flac

8230-279154-0005,all that i am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember,7.72,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0005.flac
8230-279154-0006,the behaviourist who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour has to trust his memory in making the record,7.51,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0006.flac
8230-279154-0007,habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviourist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times,15.905,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0007.flac
8230-279154-0008,but i do not think such an inference is warranted,3.62,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0008.flac
8230-279154-0009,our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image,16.91,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0009.flac
8230-279154-0010,we sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague which yet we do not trust for example under the influence of fatigue we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly but horribly distorted,15.19,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0010.flac
8230-279154-0011,some images like some sensations feel very familiar while others feel strange,6.25,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0011.flac

8230-279154-0013,in an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts,14.56,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0013.flac
8230-279154-0014,i come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past,7.94,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0014.flac
8230-279154-0015,they must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past,8.05,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0015.flac
8230-279154-0016,in actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event,10.6,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0016.flac
8230-279154-0017,there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned,7.93,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0017.flac
8230-279154-0018,there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events,11.845,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0018.flac
8230-279154-0019,it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events,18.145,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0019.flac
8230-279154-0020,if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple,7.835,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0020.flac
8230-279154-0021,remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered,6.56,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0021.flac
8230-279154-0022,some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at,6.44,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0022.flac
8230-279154-0023,in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague,6.265,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0023.flac
8230-279154-0024,the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past,6.34,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0024.flac
8230-279154-0025,we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy,21.78,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0025.flac
8230-279154-0026,this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory,9.3,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0026.flac
8230-279154-0027,a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe,11.135,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0027.flac
8230-279154-0028,i can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this,11.56,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0028.flac
8230-279154-0029,the fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it,8.54,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0029.flac
8230-279154-0030,semon's two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely,7.28,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0030.flac
8230-279154-0031,they give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory,12.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0031.flac
8230-279154-0032,it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge,3.88,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0032.flac
8230-279154-0033,it is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time,11.69,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0033.flac
8230-279154-0034,whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar,14.51,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0034.flac
8230-279154-0035,thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone,7.555,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0035.flac
8230-279154-0036,a further stage is recognition,3.235,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0036.flac
8230-279154-0037,recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment,20.535,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0037.flac
8230-279154-0038,we are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word,22.49,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0038.flac
8230-279154-0039,this knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not,4.59,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0039.flac
8230-279154-0040,there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before,16.695,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0040.flac
8230-279154-0041,the definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important,14.945,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0041.flac
8230-279154-0042,thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world,18.76,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0042.flac
8230-279154-0043,of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition,24.485,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-clean/8230-279154-0043.flac
