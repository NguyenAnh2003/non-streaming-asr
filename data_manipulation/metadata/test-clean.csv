4350-9170-0000,educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order,6.835,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0000.flac
4350-9170-0001,this is absolutely incorrect,2.06,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0001.flac
4350-9170-0002,in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group,9.31,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0002.flac
4350-9170-0003,the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible,9.245,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0003.flac
4350-9170-0004,the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires,4.415,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0004.flac
4350-9170-0005,the basis of authority is bodily violence,2.565,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0005.flac
4350-9170-0006,the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison in submission to one will,8.14,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0006.flac
4350-9170-0007,these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army,4.755,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0007.flac
4350-9170-0008,the army has always been and still is the basis of power,3.535,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0008.flac
4350-9170-0009,power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure,13.95,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0009.flac
4350-9170-0010,indeed it could not be otherwise,2.285,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0010.flac
4350-9170-0011,only under those conditions could the social organization be justified,3.745,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0011.flac
4350-9170-0012,but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification,10.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0012.flac
4350-9170-0013,even if there was once a time when owing to the low standard of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting,15.405,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0013.flac
4350-9170-0014,between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure,8.745,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0014.flac
4350-9170-0015,it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest,6.44,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0015.flac
4350-9170-0016,after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself,7.47,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0016.flac
4350-9170-0017,but this justification is never more than temporary,2.825,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0017.flac
4350-9170-0018,internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissentient individuals,7.095,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0018.flac
4350-9170-0019,government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government,11.72,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0019.flac
4350-9170-0020,and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs,7.42,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0020.flac
4350-9170-0021,the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient times subdued by conquest,9.565,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0021.flac
4350-9170-0022,so it has always been,1.83,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0022.flac
4350-9170-0023,footnote the fact that in america the abuses of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it,9.5,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0023.flac
4350-9170-0024,the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army,9.89,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0024.flac
4350-9170-0025,the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers,17.13,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0025.flac
4350-9170-0026,the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses,10.3,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0026.flac
4350-9170-0027,and this abnormal order of things is maintained by the army,3.045,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0027.flac
4350-9170-0028,but there is not only one government there are other governments exploiting their subjects by violence in the same way and always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects,10.485,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0028.flac
4350-9170-0029,and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands,4.42,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0029.flac
4350-9170-0030,this increase is contagious as montesquieu pointed out one hundred fifty years ago,4.245,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0030.flac
4350-9170-0031,every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies,9.67,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0031.flac
4350-9170-0032,the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism,8.71,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0032.flac
4350-9170-0033,the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense,13.17,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0033.flac
4350-9170-0034,and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practiced upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors,7.185,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0034.flac
4350-9170-0035,this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service,3.875,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0035.flac
4350-9170-0036,in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transference of the aim of life to groups of persons,13.525,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0036.flac
4350-9170-0037,but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid,11.93,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0037.flac
4350-9170-0038,but instead of doing that they expose the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors,7.8,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0038.flac
4350-9170-0039,the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend,6.875,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0039.flac
4350-9170-0040,the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless,6.28,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0040.flac
4350-9170-0041,but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that,8.465,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0041.flac
4350-9170-0042,governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true,4.715,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0042.flac
4350-9170-0043,they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own,10.28,../data_manipulation/librispeech/test-custom-other/4350-9170-0043.flac
