7067-76048-0045,and then he would direct his attention to a kind of masculinization of his daughter and to schemes for giving her the completest control of all he had to leave her provided she never married nor fell under masculine sway after all,14.01,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0045.flac
7067-76048-0046,he would reflect as he hesitated over the practicability of his life's ideal there was hetty green this latter idea had reft her suddenly at the age of seventeen from the educational care of an english gentlewoman warranted to fit her for marriage with any prince in europe,16.05,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0046.flac
7067-76048-0047,after a swift but competent training into a shirt waist and an office down town she had been entrusted at first to a harvester concern independent of mister grammont because he feared his own people wouldn't train her hard,12.325,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0047.flac
7067-76048-0048,she had worked for ordinary wages and ordinary hours and at the end of the day she mentioned casually a large automobile with two menservants,7.86,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0048.flac
7067-76048-0049,this masculinization idea had also sent her on a commission of enquiry into mexico there apparently she had really done responsible work but upon the question of labour mister grammont was fierce,11.895,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0049.flac

7067-76048-0051,and the idea of a matrimonial alliance with gunter lake gunter lake sir richmond gathered wasn't half a bad fellow generally it would seem miss grammont liked him and she had a way of speaking about him that suggested that in some way,14.075,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0051.flac
7067-76048-0052,mister lake had been rather hardly used and had acquired merit by his behaviour under bad treatment there was some story however connected with her war services in europe upon which miss grammont was evidently indisposed to dwell,14.12,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0052.flac
7067-76048-0053,still quite vaguely guessing so much fact about miss grammont as we have given had floated up in fragments and pieced itself together in sir richmond's mind in the course of a day and a half the fragments came up as allusions or by way of illustration,14.88,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0053.flac

7067-76048-0055,for a number of trivial reasons sir richmond found himself ascribing the project of this new age almost wholly to doctor martineau and presenting it as a much completer scheme than he was justified in doing it was true that doctor martineau had not said many of the things sir richmond ascribed to him,16.68,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0055.flac
7067-76048-0056,but also it was true that they had not crystallized out in sir richmond's mind before his talks with doctor martineau the idea of a new age necessarily carries with it the idea of fresh rules of conduct and of different relationships between human beings,14.96,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0056.flac
7067-76048-0057,and it throws those who talk about it into the companionship of a common enterprise to morrow the new age will be here no doubt but today it is the hope and adventure of only a few human beings so that it was natural for miss grammont and sir richmond to ask,15.725,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/7067-76048-0057.flac

4853-27671-0001,i had at one time during the black hours struck into a mournful calculation and reckoned that the brig would float some two or three hours after sunrise,10.16,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0001.flac
4853-27671-0002,and a deep of rolling sapphire i started with sudden terror to observe how close the covering board sat upon the water and how the head of every swell ran past as high as the bulwark rail,13.095,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0002.flac
4853-27671-0003,yet for a few moments i stood contemplating the scene of ruin it was visible now to its most trifling detail the foremast was gone smooth off at the deck it lay over the starboard bow,13.505,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0003.flac
4853-27671-0004,one extraordinary stroke i quickly detected the jolly boat had lain stowed in the long boat it was thus we carried those boats the little one lying snugly enough in the other the sea that had flooded our decks,14.345,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0004.flac
4853-27671-0005,had floated the jolly boat out of the long boat and swept it bottom up to the gangway where it lay as though god's mercy designed it should be preserved for my use for not long after it had been floated out the brig struck the berg the masts fell,15.505,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0005.flac

4853-27671-0007,and so made a tackle by the help of which i turned the jolly boat over i then with a handspike prised her nose to the gangway secured a bunch of rope on either side her to act as fenders or buffers,13.365,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0007.flac
4853-27671-0008,when she should be launched and lying alongside ran her midway out by the tackle and attaching a line to a ring bolt in her bow shoved her over the side and she fell with a splash shipping scarce a hatful of water,14.955,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0008.flac
4853-27671-0009,but i met with an oar that had belonged to the other boat and this with the mast and sail i dropped into her the swell lifting her up to my hand when the blue fold swung past my next business was to victual her,15.38,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/4853-27671-0009.flac

403-126855-0006,thought it would be easy for his army to find them because the doctor was in a strange land and would not know his way but he was wrong because the monkey chee chee knew all the paths through the jungle better even than the king's men did,15.795,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0006.flac

403-126855-0008,so there they stayed the whole night through they often heard the king's men searching and talking in the jungle round about but they were quite safe for no one knew of that hiding place but chee chee not even the other monkeys,14.86,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0008.flac

403-126855-0013,they would sit round it in a ring listening to polynesia singing songs about the sea or to chee chee telling stories of the jungle and many of the tales that chee chee told were very interesting,13.26,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0013.flac
403-126855-0014,because although the monkeys had no history books of their own before doctor dolittle came to write them for them they remember everything that happens by telling stories to their children,12.69,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0014.flac

403-126855-0017,they were still being followed by the king's men if chee chee had known this he would most likely have hidden them again but he didn't know it one day chee chee climbed up a high rock and looked out over the tree tops,14.87,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0017.flac
403-126855-0018,these monkeys made a tremendous noise cheering and waving leaves and swinging out of the branches to greet him they wanted to carry his bag and his trunk and everything he had and one of the bigger ones even carried gub gub,16.075,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0018.flac

403-126855-0020,and he saw the captain of the army sneaking through the trees so he hurried after the doctor and told him to run then they all ran harder than they had ever run in their lives and the king's men,14.09,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0020.flac
403-126855-0021,coming after them began to run too and the captain ran hardest of all then the doctor tripped over his medicine bag and fell down in the mud and the captain thought he would surely catch him this time,13.89,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0021.flac

403-126855-0023,by this time the doctor had picked himself up and on they went again running and running and chee chee shouted it's all right we haven't far to go now,12.14,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0023.flac

403-126855-0025,and the land of the monkeys was on the other side across the river and jip the dog looked down over the edge of the steep steep cliff and said golly how are we ever going to get across,14.72,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/403-126855-0025.flac

5688-41232-0019,the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralize the dangerous influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times the general effect of these rules is to keep the girl suspended so to say between heaven and earth,14.505,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/5688-41232-0019.flac

5688-41232-0021,the precautions thus taken to isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by regard for her own safety as well as for the safety of others in short the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful force which if not kept within bounds,15.36,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/5688-41232-0021.flac

5688-41232-0031,the prohibition to drink wine the blood of the grape found among some peoples is traced to its resemblance to blood and to its sacrificial employment as among the ancient arabians and still in the christian sacrament as a substitute for drinking blood,15.075,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/5688-41232-0031.flac

8098-275181-0006,and two or three ominous little wads of feathers with one long tail feather adrift thereupon we concluded that the turkey had accidentally fallen down out of the butternut had a fit perhaps,13.94,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/8098-275181-0006.flac

6476-57446-0001,with long hair coming towards him who when he saw genzaburo cried out dear me why this must be my young lord genzaburo who has come out to enjoy himself genzaburo thought this rather strange but,14.6,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0001.flac
6476-57446-0002,looking at the man attentively recognized him as a retainer whom he had had in his employ the year before and said this is a curious meeting pray what have you been about since you left my service at any rate,14.04,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0002.flac
6476-57446-0003,i may congratulate you on being well and strong where are you living now well sir since i parted from you i have been earning a living as a fortune teller at kanda and have changed my name to kaji sazen,13.75,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0003.flac
6476-57446-0004,i am living in a poor and humble house but if your lordship at your leisure would honour me with a visit well it's a lucky chance that has brought us together and i certainly will go and see you besides i want you to do something for me,15.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0004.flac

6476-57446-0006,i will take my leave for to night good night then we shall meet the day after to morrow and so the two parted and went their several ways to rest on the appointed day genzaburo made his preparations and went in disguise without any retainers,16.025,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0006.flac
6476-57446-0007,to call upon sazen who met him at the porch of his house and said this is a great honour my lord genzaburo is indeed welcome my house is very mean but let me invite your lordship to come into an inner chamber,14.52,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0007.flac
6476-57446-0008,pray replied genzaburo don't make any ceremony for me don't put yourself to any trouble on my account and so he passed in and sazen called to his wife to prepare wine and condiments and they began to feast,15.165,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0008.flac
6476-57446-0009,at last genzaburo looking sazen in the face said there is a service which i want you to render me a very secret service but as if you were to refuse me i should be put to shame before i tell you what that service is,15.665,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0009.flac
6476-57446-0010,well then said genzaburo greatly pleased and drawing ten riyos from his bosom this is but a small present to make to you on my first visit but pray accept it no indeed i don't know what your lordship wishes of me,14.34,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0010.flac
6476-57446-0011,how he had first met her and fallen in love with her at the adzuma bridge how chokichi had introduced her to him at the tea house at oji and then when she fell ill and he wanted to see her again instead of bringing her to him had only given him good advice,15.46,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0011.flac
6476-57446-0012,and so genzaburo drew a lamentable picture of his state of despair sazen listened patiently to his story and after reflecting for a while replied well sir it's not a difficult matter to set right,14.1649375,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0012.flac
6476-57446-0013,when genzaburo heard this he felt greatly relieved and recommending sazen to do his best in the matter took his leave and returned home that very night sazen after thinking over all that genzaburo had told him,14.6,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0013.flac
6476-57446-0014,laid his plans accordingly and went off to the house of kihachi the eta chief and told him the commission with which he had been entrusted kihachi was of course greatly astonished and said some time ago sir chokichi came here,15.425,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0014.flac
6476-57446-0015,and said that my lord genzaburo having been rebuked by his family for his profligate behaviour had determined to break off his connection with my daughter of course i knew that the daughter of an eta was no fitting match for a nobleman,13.635,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0015.flac
6476-57446-0016,so when chokichi came and told me the errand upon which he had been sent i had no alternative but to announce to my daughter that she must give up all thought of his lordship since that time she has been fretting and pining and starving for love,14.15,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0016.flac
6476-57446-0017,but when i tell her what you have just said how glad and happy she will be let me go and talk to her at once,6.81,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0017.flac
6476-57446-0018,well at any rate i have some news for you that will make you happy a messenger has come from my lord genzaburo for whom your heart yearns at this o koyo who had been crouching down like a drooping flower gave a great start and cried out is that really true,16.21,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0018.flac
6476-57446-0019,it is chokichi who has been throwing obstacles in the way at last his lordship has secretly sent a man called kaji sazen a fortune teller to arrange an interview between you so now my child you may cheer up,14.325,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0019.flac
6476-57446-0020,and go to meet your lover as soon as you please when o koyo heard this she was so happy that she thought it must all be a dream and doubted her own senses kihachi in the meanwhile rejoined sazen in the other room and,14.77,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0020.flac
6476-57446-0021,after telling him of the joy with which his daughter had heard the news put before him wine and other delicacies i think said sazen that the best way would be for o koyo to live secretly in my lord genzaburo's house,13.66,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0021.flac
6476-57446-0022,but as it will never do for all the world to know of it it must be managed very quietly and further when i get home i must think out some plan to lull the suspicions of that fellow chokichi and let you know my idea by letter,14.2,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0022.flac
6476-57446-0023,meanwhile o koyo had better come home with me to night although she is so terribly out of spirits now she shall meet genzaburo the day after to morrow kihachi reported this to o koyo and as her pining for genzaburo was the only cause of her sickness,15.905,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0023.flac
6476-57446-0024,she recovered her spirits at once and saying that she would go with sazen immediately joyfully made her preparations then sazen having once more warned kihachi to keep the matter secret from chokichi and to act upon the letter which he should send him,16.37,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0024.flac
6476-57446-0025,returned home taking with him o koyo and after o koyo had bathed and dressed her hair and painted herself and put on beautiful clothes she came out looking so lovely that no princess in the land could vie with her and sazen when he saw her,15.54,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0025.flac
6476-57446-0026,said to himself that it was no wonder that genzaburo had fallen in love with her then as it was getting late he advised her to go to rest and after showing her to her apartments went to his own room and wrote his letter to kihachi,14.38,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0026.flac
6476-57446-0027,containing the scheme which he had devised when kihachi received his instructions he was filled with admiration at sazen's ingenuity and putting on an appearance of great alarm and agitation,12.995,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0027.flac
6476-57446-0028,went off immediately to call on chokichi and said to him oh master chokichi such a terrible thing has happened pray let me tell you all about it indeed what can it be oh sir answered kihachi,14.88,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0028.flac
6476-57446-0029,pretending to wipe away his tears my daughter o koyo mourning over her separation from my lord genzaburo at first refused all sustenance and remained nursing her sorrows until last night her woman's heart failing to bear up against her great grief,16.09,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0029.flac
6476-57446-0030,she drowned herself in the river leaving behind her a paper on which she had written her intention when chokichi heard this he was thunderstruck and exclaimed can this really be true and when i think that it was i who first introduced her to my lord,14.885,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0030.flac

6476-57446-0035,and as luck would have it it was the very letter which contained sazen's instructions to kihachi and in which the whole story which had just affected him so much was made up when he perceived the trick that had been played upon him he was very angry and exclaimed,15.9,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0035.flac
6476-57446-0036,and all in vain well they've gulled me once but i'll be even with them yet and hinder their game before it is played out,7.85,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0036.flac

6476-57446-0055,there is no o koyo here and i never saw such a person in my life chokichi quietly drew out of the bosom of his dress the letter from sazen to kihachi which he had picked up a few days before and showing it to sazen replied,15.62,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0055.flac

6476-57446-0060,you shall have the hundred riyos you ask for but as i have not so much money by me at present i will go to genzaburo's house and fetch it it's getting dark now but it's not very late,12.005,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0060.flac
6476-57446-0061,so i'll trouble you to come with me and then i can give you the money to night chokichi consenting to this the pair left the house together now sazen who as a ronin wore a long dirk in his girdle,12.92,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0061.flac
6476-57446-0062,kept looking out for a moment when chokichi should be off his guard in order to kill him but chokichi kept his eyes open and did not give sazen a chance at last chokichi as ill luck would have it stumbled against a stone and fell,15.27,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0062.flac
6476-57446-0063,and sazen profiting by the chance drew his dirk and stabbed him in the side and as chokichi taken by surprise tried to get up he cut him severely over the head until at last he fell dead,13.48,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0063.flac
6476-57446-0064,sazen then looking around him and seeing to his great delight that there was no one near returned home the following day chokichi's body was found by the police and when they examined it they found nothing upon it save a paper which they read,15.03,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0064.flac
6476-57446-0065,and which proved to be the very letter which sazen had sent to kihachi and which chokichi had picked up the matter was immediately reported to the governor and sazen having been summoned an investigation was held,14.48,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0065.flac
6476-57446-0066,sazen cunning and bold murderer as he was lost his self possession when he saw what a fool he had been not to get back from chokichi the letter which he had written and when he was put to a rigid examination under torture,14.545,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0066.flac

6476-57446-0068,as he had disgraced his position as a hatamoto by contracting an alliance with the daughter of an eta his property should be confiscated his family blotted out and himself banished as for kihachi the eta chief and his daughter o koyo,15.605,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0068.flac
6476-57446-0069,and by him they too were banished while sazen against whom the murder of chokichi had been fully proved was executed according to law note at asakusa in yedo there lives a man called danzayemon,15.495,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0069.flac

6476-57446-0076,thus their race is polluted and accursed and they are hated accordingly now this is how the etas came to be under the jurisdiction of danzayemon when minamoto no yoritomo was yet a child his father minamoto no yoshitomo,15.575,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0076.flac

6476-57446-0079,but that if he killed her children she would destroy herself rather than yield to his desire when he heard this kiyomori bewildered by the beauty of tokiwa spared the lives of her children but banished them from the capital,13.855,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0079.flac

6476-57446-0082,and he grew up to be a peasant now kiyomori the enemy of yoritomo had been gathered to his fathers and yoritomo had avenged the death of his father by slaying munemori the son of kiyomori and there was peace throughout the land,14.885,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/6476-57446-0082.flac

1069-133699-0035,it's very true i did encourage him and then she asked if her companion had learned from mister goodwood what he intended to do it was a concession to her curiosity for she disliked discussing the subject,14.055,../data_manipulation/librispeech/augmented-train/1069-133699-0035.flac
